Gruffalo
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/outbrain/gruffalo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/outbrain/gruffalo)

Gruffalo is an asynchronous Netty based graphite proxy.
It protects Graphite from the herds of clients by minimizing context switches and interrupts; by batching and aggregating metrics.

Gruffalo also allows you to replicate metrics between Graphite installations for DR scenarios, for example.

Gruffalo can easily handle a massive amount of traffic, and thus increase your metrics delivery system availability.

At Outbrain, we currently handle over 1700 concurrent connections, and over 2M metrics per minute per instance.
